                    <p>Dan was a godsend when my mother was nearing the end of her life. He traveled all the way from Florida with his husband and dog just to help care for her. Dan not only changed, fed, and cleaned my mom, but he also provided companionship and support so our family could rest or run errands without worry.</p>

                    <p>Dan is truly compassionate, respectful, and professional. My father always looked forward to his visits. Itâ€™s rare to find someone with such a genuine heart and deep commitment to elder care.</p>

                    <p>We hired Dan after trying a few agencies, and the difference was night and day. With Dan, the care felt personal. He was attentive to every need and incredibly helpful with managing daily routines and medical reminders.</p>
